## Project Overview

> This project demonstrates linear regression from both a theoretical and applied perspective. It begins with a matrix algebra derivation of the quadratic form \( \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} \), and continues with a Python implementation of linear regression using the normal equation to model Olympic winning times as a function of year.

### âœ… Question 1 â€“ Matrix Derivation
- Expanded the quadratic form \( \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} \) using matrix multiplication
- Expressed it as:
  \[
  w_0^2 \sum x_{i1}^2 + 2w_0w_1 \sum x_{i1}x_{i2} + w_1^2 \sum x_{i2}^2
  \]
- Demonstrated this step-by-step using Python and LaTeX formatting

### âœ… Question 2 â€“ Linear Regression on Olympic Data
- Loaded Olympic year and race time data
- Implemented linear regression using the **normal equation**:
  \[
  \mathbf{w} = (\mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{t}
  \]
- Computed coefficients \( w_0 \) and \( w_1 \)
- Plotted the regression line over the Olympic data
